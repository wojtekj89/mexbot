# Mexbot
## Project background
Bitmex is one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges. They do not offer FIAT purchases but they specialize in margin trading on different instruments. Users are connecting to the platform with web or mobile app. Due to rapid growth of users their trading engine is overloaded and users need to try to place their order multiple times before they are in the orderbook. All orders need to be placed separately so user need to repeat same procedure multiple times in case of more complicated orders or rejections from their API.

## Scope definition
Mexbot will suppliment Bitmex with customized order types like scaled order and make sure that orders are placed in the orderbook during overload. Our application will not replace bitmex but add small side panel where orders are placed. We will not create whole panel in the initial phase.
